   About:
   
      This our entry for SpeedHack 2007, http://www.speedhack.allegro.cc/
      
      Created in 72 hours by
      
        Per Larsson: Code, Additional Graphics, Sound & Music
        
        Olof Naessen: Code, Graphics
        
        Ted Steen: Code


   Controls:
   
      * W, S, A, D or arrow keys to move
      
      * Mouse to aim
      
      * Left mouse button to shoot
      
      * Right mouse button to use Megablast
      
      * P pauses the game.


   Implemented rules:
   
      * Evilness
        (you'll see)
        
      * Radius of Influence
        Implemented as magnetic mines that seeks the player
        
      * Get a Grip
        Different levels have different air friction
        
      * Reverse Stereotypes
        We think our characters are quite novel, at least
        
      * Dialogue
        The player is given a choice to either go to the bonus level
        or to upgrade a few times in the game, implemented as a dialogue.
        The upgrade shop is also a dialogue (sort of).


   The following rule has been omitted (thanks to rule 'Act of Generosity'):

      * Ratio, Respect!
