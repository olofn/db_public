      This our entry for TINS 2012, http://tins.amarillion.org/2012
      
      Created in 72 hours by
      
	Per Svanberg:         Code, Graphics, Music
	Daniel Johansson      Code, Graphics
        Olof Naessen:         Code, Graphics, Music        

   Controls:
      * Arrow keys to move
      * X to use gravity granades (needs to found before you can use it)
      * Z to use power gun (needs to found before you can use it)
	  
	There are exprimental Xbox 360 controller support implemented.

   Implemented rules:
      * Genre rule #79 Creative anachronism: combine two elements that are 
	    obviously from different time area's:
        A robot from the future ends up in the ruins of a forgotten 
		civilization doomed by pre-historic earth dragons.
        
      * Artistical rule #56 Here be dragons
        We have dragons!
	        
      * Technical rule #42 Must have way to record progress / save games
        The game can be saved at save points.
        
      * Technical rule #61 Multilayer scrolling (=parallax scrolling)
        The game has parallax scrolled backgrounds.
        
      * Technical rule #64 Prominent use of prime numbers
        We really went the extra mile on this one and made sure that all 
		possible integers in the game, as well as in the source code and 
		memory, can be expressed as a product of one or more prime numbers!! 
		We even made a reference to this in the title of the game!!!
		
   Code reuse:
      * Code from our own framework mainly developed during Tins and 
	    Speedhack competitions in the past. 

   Music:
      * Composed by us, mostly prior to the competition, some during the 
	    competition.

   Libraries Needed:
      * Dumb, http://dumb.sourceforge.net/
      * tmx-parser, http://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser/
